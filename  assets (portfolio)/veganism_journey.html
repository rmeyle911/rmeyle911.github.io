<p>I have always loved animals since I was a little kid. I can vividly remember when I found a robin that had fallen out of a tree. I was set on nursing the hurt animal back to health. A while after this, we had built our own farm. My father had baby turkeys that were attacked by a cat. Most of them had already succumbed to their injuries but there was one left. I had so much hope for that little bird, unfortunately the injuries were too great and it had passed away. At that moment my heart shattered. From then on I swore to never eat another animal again. Fast forward to now, I have been vegetarian for over eight years. I have made it my mission to never shove my decisions and lifestyle down anyone's throat. I feel this approach to veganism/vegetarianism hurts the overall cause. I tend to briefly mention it, answer the time old question of how I get my protein, and then I try my best to educate others on my personal and environmental reasons of why I chose this route.</p>

<p>*Note: While I know there are environmental impacts of every kind of diet, I have found this is what works for me, and makes me feel like I am doing my part for this world.</p>
