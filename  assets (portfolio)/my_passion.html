<p>My passion for protecting our environment started very early for me. I have always spent time exploring outside. Growing in Michigan allowed me to have access to all seasons, and plenty of outdoor areas to enjoy. As an adult now I go hiking, camping, swimming, etc. Being able to be out in nature is such a special privilege that many take for granted. When I had to start thinking about careers I wanted to be a marine biologist. This might have been influenced by the movie Finding Nemo and my slight obsession with nudibranchs (sea slugs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my path has shifted slightly away from the marine aspect, but my passion is still there. I recently moved to North Carolina and had an opportunity to participate in a beach clean up. It may be silly to others but this experience was always on my bucket list. When I was in high school I discovered I enjoy not only the environment, but for helping people too. I would bake cookies for our local homeless shelter. Baking sweets helped me decompress after a long day of school and I got to help someone in need. I feel this experience sparked something in me, I wanted a career that not only helped animals but people too.</p>

I got the opportunity to sit by myself in the woods and observe what I saw all around me. It was an experience I would not trade for the world.<br>
