<p>Located here I have written out my transcripts. As you can see I have done really well in all of my STEM related classes. I put my all into these classes, since they are the ones building my future. I was very successful in high school. I received multiple awards for my achievements. I feel this drive has continued over into my college academics. I have been on the Deanâ€™s list multiple times in my college career. This gives me a lot of pride because during those times I was working full time hours and taking four classes at the same time.</p>

<p> My grades are not straight A's, but this was only a few of the classes I have taken. My first two years were extreme learning curves. Due to the pandemic, I had to go back and forth from in person learning, to online classes multiple times. I got the opportunity to learn how to balance multiple classes with a full work schedule. I am excited for earning my bachelors degree so I can apply what I have learned in order to improve more. </p>
